# nxos-sample
Use Nxus 9000v's rest api to get device's information which will be described in the website.
In the following, i'll use nxos in place of Nxus 9000v.

Nxos is a series of virtual switch of cisco which is different from traditional switch.
The diffrentation is nxos only has data plane, which means it's more simple without concerning how to establish its flow table.

You can find how to deploy a nxos with the following url:
